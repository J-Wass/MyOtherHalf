# MyOtherHalf
An HTML5 puzzle game backed by Python Flask where each user has half of the abilities of a player to complete a level. 
Ex) User 1 can make the player move left and jump, while user 2 can make the player move right and drop down.


Run
```pip install flask```
and
```pip install flask-socketio```
if you want to play with the source code. Disclaimer: it will be unstable until I release (which may never happen, lol).

Uses Python 2 but someone could probably easily move it to 3.
